#AsyncProgramminKata
This is an example of Asynchronous programming with async and await.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/

The example shows how to make a breakfast executing the following instructions asynchronously.

1. Pour a cup of coffee.
2. Heat up a pan, then fry two eggs.
3. Fry three slices of bacon.
4. Toast two pieces of bread.
5. Add butter and jam to the toast.
6. Pour a glass of orange juice.

In a synchronous programming we can obtain a result like this:

```
Pouring coffee
coffee is ready
Warming the egg pan...
cracking 2 eggs
cooking the eggs ...
Put eggs on plate
eggs are ready
putting 3 slices of bacon in the pan
cooking first side of bacon...
flipping a slice of bacon
flipping a slice of bacon
flipping a slice of bacon
cooking the second side of bacon...
Put bacon on plate
bacon is ready
Putting a slice of bread in the toaster
Putting a slice of bread in the toaster
Start toasting...
Remove toast from toaster
Putting butter on the toast
Putting jam on the toast
